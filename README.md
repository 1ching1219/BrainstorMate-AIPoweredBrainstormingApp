## Expo
- Simply put, our original implementation is using React.js (WebBased); but Expo needs React Native Framework(AppBased), so restructured and re-coded the expo-frontend
- Is at Expo-testing branch 
- VideoConferencing not implemented yet.
- [Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/)
```bash
cd expo_frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
# To run
npx expo start --tunnel
```
To connect with the db, use ngrok to listen
and place ngrok link at video_app\expo_frontend\src\services\api.js
[ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/windows)
also run backend django server
both two port should be the same
